We are given a string S of length N consisting only of letters 'A' and/or 'B'. Our goal is to obtain a string in the format
"A...AB B" (all letters 'A' occur before all letters 'B') by deleting some letters from S. In particular, strings consisting only of letters 
'A' or only of letters 'B' fit this format.

Examples : 
1. Given S = "BAAABABA", the function should return 2.
2. Given S = "BBABAA", the function should return 3.
3. Given S = "AABBBB", the function should return 0.
